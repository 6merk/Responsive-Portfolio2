# Responsive-Portfolio2

https://github.com/6merk/Responsive-Portfolio2/blob/master/Basic-Portfolio/index.html

For this assignment we were supposed to make our previous portfolio responsive using the @ media function. I had completed the assignment in full but at the last minute found out that I didnt save so it only moves the sidebar when the screen goes below 640px, I'll be fixing this later today.
